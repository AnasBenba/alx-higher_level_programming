# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository provides an overview and examples of two important data structures in Python: sets and dictionaries.

## Set

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or by using the set() function. Some key features of sets include:

Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements.
Sets can perform mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.
Example:

```
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}
fruits.add('pear')
fruits.remove('banana')
```

## Dictionary

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and used to access its associated value. Dictionaries are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} with each key-value pair separated by a colon :. Some key features of dictionaries include:

Keys must be immutable types such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
Values can be of any type and can be accessed, modified, or deleted using their keys.
Dictionaries are useful for storing and retrieving data in an organized manner.
Example:

```
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}
student['age'] = 21
del student['grade']
```

This repository includes more examples and explanations of set and dictionary operations to help you understand and utilize these data structures effectively in your Python programs.

Feel free to explore the code samples and experiment with different scenarios to enhance your understanding of sets and dictionaries in Python.
